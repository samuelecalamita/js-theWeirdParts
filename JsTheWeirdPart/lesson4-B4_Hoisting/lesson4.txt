The execution Context: creation and hoisting

- hoisting:
Setup Memory Space for Variables and Functions, before the code runs.
The function is entirely place in the memory space from the js engine, 
for Variables the js engine put a placeolder for the value of the variable equal to 'undefined'

Conceptual Aside:

is not defined and undefined are not the same thing!!!
undefined is a special value that says that a variable hasnÂ´t been set.
Is not defined Is an error
